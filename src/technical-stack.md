# SORA Technical Stack

The SORA network is built with [Parity Substrate](https://substrate.io/) development framework.

This is a framework for creating blockchains that scale more efficiently than Ethereum, allowing for lower fees. Polkadot is built with Substrate, therefore projects built with Substrate can run natively on Polkadot as Parachains.
